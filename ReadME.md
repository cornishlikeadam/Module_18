# Pychain

In this Challenge, I build a blockchain-based ledger system, this system allows partnering banks to conduct financial transactions (that is, to transfer money between senders and receivers) and to verify the integrity of the data in the ledger.

# Technology

This project uses Python 3.7 and panda packages:

* [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) - Flexible and powerful data analysis / manipulation library for Python, providing labeled data structures similar to R data.frame objects, statistical functions, and much more.



# Installation Guide

Install the app's dependencies first.

```
  pip install pandas
  pip install streamlit

```
